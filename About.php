     <p>
     We now know that we generate CO2, but how do we offset this carbon? The easiest way is to plant trees, but to level with the amount of CO2 generated the number of trees to be planted would be large. Another way is to fund projects or buy carbon emission. You can fund certain projects that aims to reduce carbon footprint. For example, a organization developing and manufacturing low energy bulbs. A single low-energy lightbulb, available for just 100 rupees or so, can over the space of six years save 250kg of CO2 – equivalent to a short flight. SO a person can who want to offset his travel emission can buy this bulb and thus help in reducing emission in the future.

In some countries there are specific limit of carbon emission that a company can produce. If the limit is crossed then the company have to buy carbon offsets. 
This is called the Kyoto protocol: a party can sell an unused emissions allowance to a party above its limit. The protocol also allows carbon offsets to be traded. Kyoto Protocol parties can obtain offsets through a mechanism called joint implementation (JI), where one party develops an emission-reduction or emission-removal project in another country where emissions are limited.

     Native’s Help Build carbon offsets accomplish more than most offsets: they help fund new projects that reduce greenhouse gas pollution.
But even if you take every energy-saving step, if you are a 21st-century human, you will leave a carbon footprint. Using carbon offsets, you can counteract the greenhouse gas emissions that you cannot avoid causing.

   <label for="q3" class="panel-title">How Help Build Carbon Offsets Work?</label>
   <div class="panel-content">
     <p>
     Help Build carbon offsets are a new, progressive type of carbon offset with a bigger impact than conventional offsets.
Typically, when someone buys a carbon offset, the money goes to pay for a reduction in greenhouse gases that has already occurred. This purchase supports an existing project.
However, sometimes community-based projects don’t have enough funding to be built in the first place.
Help Build™ carbon offsets bridge the gap.
You purchase carbon offsets from a project in advance—that is, before the emission reductions occur. By doing so, you play a key role in funding its construction, enabling it to cut greenhouse gas pollution on your behalf for years to come.
By purchasing a Help Build carbon offset, you're funding new projects that will reduce carbon emissions and help communities grow.
To calculate your carbon offset, we use internationally recognized methodologies to determine the emissions that your project will reduce. Once generated, all carbon offsets also undergo third-party certification to ensure that they truly occurred
